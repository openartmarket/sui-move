# Open Art Market SUI Move contracts
This repository contains the smart contracts for the Open Art Market project.

## Contracts
1. Open Art Market
    Manages the unique asset and the sale of shares in them.
2. DAO voting 
    Manages vote proposals and votes for each of the options.

## Transparency
We use blockchain to document the our and our users actions in a transparent way. 
These contracts are deployed publicly on the [SUI blockchain] and can be verified to contain the same code. 
All assets, asset shares and votes are represented in the Objects on chain in an easy to read manner, allowing anyone to verify the state of the system.

## Further development
We would love for the community to review and improve our code. If you are interested in contributing, please read our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)
